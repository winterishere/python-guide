"Python is sometimes described with the words \"batteries included\" because "
"of its extensive `standard library <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_, "
"which includes modules for regular expressions, file IO, fraction handling, "

"Additionally, the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_ is "
"available for users to submit their packages for widespread use, similar to "
"Perl's `CPAN <http://www.cpan.org>`_. There is a thriving community of very "
