#~ "intention is better expressed by a "
#~ "signature with an extensible number of"
#~ " positional arguments, it can be "
#~ "defined with the ``*args`` constructs.  "
#~ "In the function body, ``args`` will "
#~ "be a tuple of all the remaining"
#~ " positional arguments. For example, "
#~ "``send(message, *args)`` can be called "
#~ "with each recipient as an argument: "
#~ "``send('Hello', 'God', 'Mom', 'Cthulhu')``, "

#~ "'Cthulhu')``."

#~ "dictionary** is the last way to "

#~ "function requires an undetermined series "
#~ "of named arguments, it is possible "
#~ "to use the ``**kwargs`` construct. In"
#~ " the function body, ``kwargs`` will "
#~ "be a dictionary of all the passed"
#~ " named arguments that have not been"
#~ " caught by other keyword arguments in"

#~ "A powerful tool for hackers, Python "

#~ "As seen above, Python allows many "
#~ "tricks, and some of them are "
#~ "potentially dangerous. A good example is"
#~ " that any client code can override"
#~ " an object's properties and methods: "
#~ "there is no \"private\" keyword in "
#~ "Python. This philosophy, very different "
#~ "from highly defensive languages like "
#~ "Java, which give a lot of "
#~ "mechanisms to prevent any misuse, is "
#~ "expressed by the saying: \"We are "
#~ "all consenting adults\"."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Using this convention generously is "
#~ "encouraged: any method or property that"
#~ " is not intended to be used by"
#~ " client code should be prefixed with"
#~ " an underscore. This will guarantee a"
#~ " better separation of duties and "
#~ "easier modification of existing code; it"
#~ " will always be possible to publicize"
#~ " a private property, while privatising "
#~ "a public property might be a much"
#~ " harder operation."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Even though both functions look "
#~ "identical, because *lookup_dict* is utilizing"
#~ " the fact that dictionaries in Python"
#~ " are hashtables, the lookup performance "
#~ "between the two is very different. "
#~ "Python will have to go through "
#~ "each item in the list to find "
#~ "a matching case, which is time "
#~ "consuming. By analysing the hash of "
#~ "the dictionary, finding keys in the "
#~ "dict can be done very quickly. For"
