"Getting used to writing the testing code and the running code in parallel is"
" now considered a good habit. Used wisely, this method helps you define more"

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:12
msgid ""
"A testing unit should focus on one tiny bit of functionality and prove it "
"correct."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:15
msgid ""
"Each test unit must be fully independent. Each of them must be able to run "
"alone, and also within the test suite, regardless of the order they are "
"called. The implication of this rule is that each test must be loaded with a"
" fresh dataset and may have to do some cleanup afterwards. This is usually "
"handled by :meth:`setUp()` and :meth:`tearDown()` methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:21
msgid ""
"Try hard to make tests that run fast. If one single test needs more than a "
"few millisecond to run, development will be slowed down or the tests will "
"not be run as often as desirable. In some cases, tests can't be fast because"
" they need a complex data structure to work on, and this data structure must"
" be loaded every time the test runs. Keep these heavier tests in a separate "
"test suite that is run by some scheduled task, and run all other tests as "
"often as needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:29
msgid ""
"Learn your tools and learn how to run a single test or a test case. Then, "
"when developing a function inside a module, run this function's tests very "
"often, ideally automatically when you save the code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:33
msgid ""
"Always run the full test suite before a coding session, and run it again "
"after. This will give you more confidence that you did not break anything in"
" the rest of the code."

"It is a good idea to implement a hook that runs all tests before pushing "
"code to a shared repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:40
msgid ""
"If you are in the middle of a development session and have to interrupt your"
" work, it is a good idea to write a broken unit test about what you want to "
"develop next. When coming back to work, you will have a pointer to where you"
" were and get back on track faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:45
msgid ""
"The first step when you are debugging your code is to write a new test "
"pinpointing the bug. While it is not always possible to do, those bug "
"catching tests are among the most valuable pieces of code in your project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:49
msgid ""
"Use long and descriptive names for testing functions. The style guide here "
"is slightly different than that of running code, where short names are often"
" preferred. The reason is testing functions are never called explicitly. "
"``square()`` or even ``sqr()`` is ok in running code, but in testing code "
"you would have names such as ``test_square_of_number_2()``, "
"``test_square_negative_number()``. These function names are displayed when a"
" test fails, and should be as descriptive as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:57
msgid ""
"When something goes wrong or has to be changed, and if your code has a good "
"set of tests, you or other maintainers will rely largely on the testing "
"suite to fix the problem or modify a given behavior. Therefore the testing "
"code will be read as much as or even more than the running code. A unit test"
" whose purpose is unclear is not very helpful is this case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/tests.rst:64
msgid ""
"Another use of the testing code is as an introduction to new developers. "
"When someone will have to work on the code base, running and reading the "
"related testing code is often the best they can do. They will or should "
"discover the hot spots, where most difficulties arise, and the corner cases."
" If they have to add some functionality, the first step should be to add a "
"test and, by this means, ensure the new functionality is not already a "
"working path that has not been plugged into the interface."
