"For the most part, Python aims to be a clean and consistent language that"
" avoids surprises. However, there are a few cases that can be confusing "
"to newcomers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:8
msgid ""
"Some of these cases are intentional but can be potentially surprising. "
"Some could arguably be considered language warts. In general, what "
"follows is a collection of potentially tricky behavior that might seem "
"strange at first glance, but is generally sensible once you're aware of "
"the underlying cause for the surprise."

msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:57
msgid ""
"A new list is created *once* when the function is defined, and the same "
"list is used in each successive call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:60
msgid ""
"Python's default arguments are evaluated *once* when the function is "
"defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby). "
"This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you "
"*will* and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function "
"as well."

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:68
msgid ""
"Create a new object each time the function is called, by using a default "
"arg to signal that no argument was provided (:py:data:`None` is often a "
"good choice)."

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:83

"Sometimes you can specifically \"exploit\" (read: use as intended) this "
"behavior to maintain state between calls of a function. This is often "
"done when writing a caching function."

msgid "Late Binding Closures"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:91
msgid ""
"Another common source of confusion is the way Python binds its variables "
"in closures (or in the surrounding global scope)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:110
msgid ""
"A list containing five functions that each have their own closed-over "
"``i`` variable that multiplies their argument, producing::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:130
msgid "Five functions are created; instead all of them just multiply ``x`` by 4."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:132
msgid ""
"Python's closures are *late binding*. This means that the values of "
"variables used in closures are looked up at the time the inner function "
"is called."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:136
msgid ""
"Here, whenever *any* of the returned functions are called, the value of "
"``i`` is looked up in the surrounding scope at call time. By then, the "
"loop has completed and ``i`` is left with its final value of 4."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:140
msgid ""
"What's particularly nasty about this gotcha is the seemingly prevalent "
"misinformation that this has something to do with :ref:`lambdas "
"<python:lambda>` in Python. Functions created with a ``lambda`` "
"expression are in no way special, and in fact the same exact behavior is "
"exhibited by just using an ordinary ``def``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:161
msgid ""
"The most general solution is arguably a bit of a hack. Due to Python's "
"aforementioned behavior concerning evaluating default arguments to "
"functions (see :ref:`default_args`), you can create a closure that binds "
"immediately to its arguments by using a default arg like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:171
msgid "Alternatively, you can use the functools.partial function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:184
msgid ""
"Sometimes you want your closures to behave this way. Late binding is good"
" in lots of situations. Looping to create unique functions is "
"unfortunately a case where they can cause hiccups."

msgid "Bytecode (.pyc) Files Everywhere!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:193
msgid ""
"By default, when executing Python code from files, the Python interpreter"
" will automatically write a bytecode version of that file to disk, e.g. "
"``module.pyc``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:197
msgid ""
"These ``.pyc`` files should not be checked into your source code "
"repositories."

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:199

"Theoretically, this behavior is on by default, for performance reasons. "
