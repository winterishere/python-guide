"Python’s standard urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP capabilities you "

"Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP — making your integration "
"with web services seamless. There’s no need to manually add query strings to"
" your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection"
" pooling are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded within "
"Requests."

"ØMQ (also spelled ZeroMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous "

"middleware, a ØMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The "
"library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API."
