"Martin Fowler, who first wrote about `Continuous Integration "

"together with Kent Beck, describes the CI as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../scenarios/ci.rst:11
msgid ""
"Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a"
" team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at "
"least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is "
"verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors"
" as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to "
"significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop "
"cohesive software more rapidly."
