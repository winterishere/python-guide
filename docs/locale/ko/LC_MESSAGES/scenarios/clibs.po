"`CFFI <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ provides a simple to use"
" mechanism for interfacing with C from both CPython and PyPy. It supports"
" two modes: an inline ABI compatibility mode (example provided below), "
"which allows you to dynamically load and run functions from executable "
"modules (essentially exposing the same functionality as LoadLibrary or "
"dlopen), and an API mode, which allows you to build C extension modules."

"`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`_ is the de facto"
" library for interfacing with C/C++ from CPython, and it provides not "
"only full access to the native C interface of most major operating "
"systems (e.g., kernel32 on Windows, or libc on \\*nix), but also provides"
" support for loading and interfacing with dynamic libraries, such as DLLs"
" or shared objects at runtime. It does bring along with it a whole host "
"of types for interacting with system APIs, and allows you to rather "
"easily define your own complex types, such as structs and unions, and "
"allows you to modify things such as padding and alignment, if needed. It "
"can be a bit crufty to use, but in conjunction with the `struct "
"<https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/struct.html>`_ module, you are "
"essentially provided full control over how your data types get translated"
" into something usable by a pure C(++) method."

"`SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_, though not strictly Python focused (it "
"supports a large number of scripting languages), is a tool for generating"
" bindings for interpreted languages from C/C++ header files. It is "
"extremely simple to use: the consumer simply needs to define an interface"
" file (detailed in the tutorial and documentations), include the "
"requisite C/C++ headers, and run the build tool against them. While it "
"does have some limits, (it currently seems to have issues with a small "
"subset of newer C++ features, and getting template-heavy code to work can"
" be a bit verbose), it provides a great deal of power and exposes lots of"
" features to Python with little effort. Additionally, you can easily "
"extend the bindings SWIG creates (in the interface file) to overload "
"operators and built-in methods, effectively re- cast C++ exceptions to be"
" catchable by Python, etc."

" to include providing wrappers to access PyObjects in C++, extracting "
"SWIG- wrapper objects, and even embedding bits of Python into your C++ "
"code."
