"By design, Python installs to a directory with the version number embedded, "
"e.g. Python version 2.7 will install at :file:`C:\\\\Python27\\\\`, so that "
"you can have multiple versions of Python on the same system without "
"conflicts. Of course, only one interpreter can be the default application "
"for Python file types. It also does not automatically modify the "
":envvar:`PATH` environment variable, so that you always have control over "
